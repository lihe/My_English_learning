　在中国文化中，红色通常象征着好运、长寿和幸福，在春节和其他喜庆场合，红色到处可见。人们把现金作为礼物送给家人或亲密朋友时，通常放在红信封里。红色在中国流行的另一个原因是人们把它与中国革命和共产党相联系。然而，红色并不总是代表好运与快乐。因为从前死者的名字常用红色书写，用红墨水写中国人名被看成是一种冒犯行为。

In Chinese culture, red is seen as good luck, health and happiness. Red can seen everywhere in Spring Festival and other happy space. People put cash in envelop as a gift to give friends and family persons. The other reason is people often connect it with China revolution. But red is not always seen as luck. Because people's name is written by red in the past. So it is a bad thing to write people's name by red ink.

在中国文化中，红色通常意味着吉祥，长寿和幸福。 在中国春节期间和其他喜庆场合中到处可见红色。 经常以红色信封包裹的现金被作为礼物送给家人或密友。 它的受欢迎程度还可以归因于人们将它与中国革命和共产党联系在一起的事实。 但是，它并不总是等于好运和快乐，因为死者的名字曾经被用红色写成。 用红色墨水写中国人的名字被视为犯罪。
